# SimpleCV
Hereâ€™s a short description of how you created this CV:

1. HTML Structure: Used `<!DOCTYPE html>` to define HTML5 and structured the page with `<head>` for metadata and `<body>` for content.

2. Metadata and SEO: Added meta tags for character encoding, viewport settings, description, and keywords to improve SEO. Included Open Graph (OG) meta tags for better social media sharing.

3. Favicon and Title: Linked a favicon for browser tab visibility. Set a descriptive `<title>` for the page.

4. Header: Displayed your name, profession, and contact details in a structured format using `<header>` and `<address>` tags. Made contact information clickable (phone, email, and LinkedIn).

5. Main Content: Used `<main>` to wrap the primary sections of the CV: **About Me**: Highlighted your professional background.**Skills**: Created a bullet list of core competencies with `<ul>` and `<li>`. **Professional Experience**: Listed job roles and responsibilities using `<article>` for each position. **Education**: Presented academic qualifications in a clear, bulleted format. **References**: Included a brief note about availability upon request.

6. Styling and Accessibility: Used semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for better readability and accessibility. Separated sections with `<hr>` for visual clarity.

7. Footer: Added a copyright notice using `<footer>`.
